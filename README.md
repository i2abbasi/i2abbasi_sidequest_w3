## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a multi-screen interactive story built using a state-based architecture. The project includes a start screen, an instructions screen, a game screen where the player makes narrative choices, and win/lose ending screens. Player decisions affect a tracked stat (Trust), which determines the final outcome of the story.

The project emphasizes separating each screen into its own file, routing input and rendering logic based on a shared currentScreen variable, and creating simple interactive UI elements such as buttons and keyboard shortcuts. The story unfolds through branching paths, showing how player agency can influence outcomes across multiple game states.
